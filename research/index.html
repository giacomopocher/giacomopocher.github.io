                                This study explores the potential for AI-powered chatbots to strengthen democracy by boosting political knowledge and engagement through better access to political information. We develop and evaluate BallotBot, an AI chatbot with access to official voter guide information from the November 2024 referendums in California. In a pre-registered three-wave survey experiment in the weeks around election day, participants (California voters) were randomly assigned to use either BallotBot or a traditional digital voter guide to answer questions about ballot initiatives. BallotBot access improved participants' ability to answer in-depth questions, reduced overconfidence, lowered the perceived cost of acquiring information for less-informed participants, and fostered greater engagement with political information. However, it had no clear effect on self-reported turnout or the direction of voting.

                                Unobserved factors, such as innate ability or motivation, often drive individual responses to treatment, challenging the effectiveness of policies designed to maximize welfare. This paper studies how to choose who to treat when treatment effects vary depending on unobserved characteristics. Building on the empirical welfare maximization framework, I prove that the welfare gain of incorporating latent variables—such as fixed effects or proxies—into policy recommendations depends on the precision of their estimator and the explanatory power of observed covariates. Since these two quantities are generally unknown, I propose a new class of rules that sets the importance of estimated unobserved characteristics through a weighting parameter, and I define a fully data-driven procedure to select it via cross-validation. I show that the selected weight mirrors the proxy's signal-to-noise ratio, and prove that the resulting policy rule achieves a higher welfare than rules that fully incorporate or ignore unobserved heterogeneity. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the theoretical predictions. I show the practical relevance of my results in an empirical application in development economics, where including proxies in policy recommendations halves the probability of generating welfare losses.
